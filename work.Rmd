The Module B2 Binned Waste team is responsible for developing a model to estimate local authorities' costs of collecting and disposing of packaging placed in street bins. 

Producers will then be required to pay these costs which will incentivise them to reduce packaging waste and make packaging more recyclable.

This brings many benefits including greater resource efficiency, reduced pollution and reduced carbon emissions, supporting nature and combatting climate change.

The [plan on a page](https://defra.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/teams/Team1478/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B14C0DDD3-867B-4EA2-BC52-CB7999CE1165%7D&file=04%20Binned_Waste_Programme_POAP_LIVE.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&PreviousSessionID=ebc4a168-d4bd-f4a1-e658-81828bc9da9f) gives timelines and milestones for developing this model.
